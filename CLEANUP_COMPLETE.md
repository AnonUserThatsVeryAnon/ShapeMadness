- `CURRENT_STATE_DOCUMENTATION.md` - State was incorrect
- `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md` - Mixed old/new information

**Total Documentation Removed**: ~2,000+ lines of misleading information

### 3. ✅ Updated Documentation

- **ROADMAP.md** - Now reflects actual current state
  - Marked tank shield fix as complete
  - Marked cleanup as complete
  - Moved refactoring to "optional" priority

  - All working features listed
  - Known issues documented
  - Clear next steps

### 4. ✅ Preserved Important Documentation

Kept all accurate, useful documentation:

- README.md - User-facing game info
- MECHANICS_REFERENCE.md - Game mechanics

## Impact

### Before Cleanup

- ❌ 3 code files claiming to do things they didn't
- ❌ 8 documentation files with false information
- ❌ Confusion about what code was actually running
- ❌ Unclear project state

### After Cleanup

- ✅ Only code that actually runs remains
- ✅ All documentation is accurate
- ✅ Clear understanding of architecture
- ✅ Honest assessment of project state

---

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: No more confusion about which code runs
2. **Honesty**: Documentation matches reality
3. **Simplicity**: Less clutter, easier to navigate
4. **Maintainability**: Future developers won't be misled
5. **Confidence**: Know exactly what the codebase does

---

## What's Next?

### Optional: Fix Minor Bugs (See ROADMAP.md)

1. Power-ups persist across restarts
2. Splitter children spawn inside player
3. Combo multiplier not displayed
4. Audio context suspension

### Optional: Future Refactoring (See REFACTORING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)

Only if you want cleaner architecture. Current code works fine!

## Summary

**Removed**: 871 lines of unused code + 2,000+ lines of wrong documentation
**Added**: Accurate PROJECT_STATUS.md + Updated ROADMAP.md
**Result**: Clean, honest, maintainable codebase

✅ **Codebase is now in excellent shape!**
